# simple_gpt2

So this is my 1st attempt on LLMs, I had followed Karpathy great tutorial here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pRSuU81PU&t=8371s
Some portions of the code are copy some others are rewriten on my own stile, so I consider this version to be simpler (and less robust) than the version from Karpathy.
